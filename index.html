Iowa hawkeyes are hosting 7, electric <br>
home football games this fall. The hawkeyes<br>
return the majority of players from their<br>
elite defense in 2021. However, a questionable<br>
Quaterback situation and lots of injured<br>
receivers leaves lots of questions about the<br>
offense. Despite the fan base being quite<br>
frustrated from our slow start losing to<br>
rivial Iowa State, Kinnick Stadium will still<br>
be absolutley rocking. HAWKS BY A MILLION!</p>
